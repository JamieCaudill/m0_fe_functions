# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?

I am most proud of the way that I'm beginning to type the proper syntax without having to look at my notes, and to read error messages and make the specified corrections. 

Functions allow us to write complicated tools that we can use multiple times.
